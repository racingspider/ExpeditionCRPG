Tower Cards - 30 cards in 4 decks marked 1-4, instead of picking an overland or interior encounter when you arrive at a non-quest way point, draw the next Tower Card. You would first shuffle each set together to make a single pile. Once a crew has completed a Tower Card, they do not repeat it, but another play through with new characters would get a shuffled set again.
