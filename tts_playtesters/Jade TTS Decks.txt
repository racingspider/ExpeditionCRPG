Jade TTS Decks

Lots of decks. Most of them aren't very full, but here's the counts:

Decks				CARDS		SINGLE BACK?
Attributes:			27			no
Bosses: 			1   		no
Boss Encounters: 	4 			no
Characters:			13 			yes
Core Play Cards:	54 			no
Encounters:			38 			no
Perils:				25 			yes
Settings:			9 			yes
Tokens:				51 			no

All of these decks are 10x7 when you import them into TTS.
Settings are the weakest deck right now (some do not have actions, etc.)

Single Back means they share the same image for the reverse side.
