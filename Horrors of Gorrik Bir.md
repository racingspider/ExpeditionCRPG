When Gorrik Bir is silent, there stirs not a single living creature. The halls are dense with a heavy silence.
Once every few generations, Gorrik Bir vomits unspeakable horrors upon the lands.

	* Mouseogre
	* Bulbous Horror
	* Bulvar Gargantuan (massive: Fight is taboo), (trample: doom)
	* Carnipillar
	* Fungal Slime
	* Voidcrawler 1 (shadow phase: Navigate is taboo), (soul drain: doom)

	* Eldricht Viperweed (ensnare), (poisonous: affliction)
	* Stone Auramensk
	* Riddling Filthfolk (obstacle)

Once the final encounter on Gorrik Bir has been resolved, flip the quest card and build the horror encountered.

## THE HORRORS (square cards)

4 different "base" monsters, then pick up to 4 Traits (based on the base):
For instance:

### YUG YUG
-------
Pick two {moon symbol} Threats => Poisonous (causes affliction), Violent (double injury)
Pick one {shield symbol} Traits => Sprawling (Navigation is taboo)
	{ shield symbol } has abilities and taboo glyphs that do not interfere with the base creature's opposing glyphs (to counter threats), so there should be enough different symbols for that.
This can be used to build many horrors to face

Other traits could be deadly breath:
Any character without magic in hand takes INJURY
