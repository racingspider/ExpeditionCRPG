These are notes I wrote down as I went through a play-session. I didn't record actual card plays (and probably should have), but instead took a light narrative approach.

We decided not to cross the river (obstacle) at The Long Graveyard, and ran into a teeming mass of horrific creatures as we tried to find another way around. No one escaped without injury.

We fought off Rohoghasts, but we are exhausted, injured and behind schedule.

The Long Graveyard was miserable. Down in some tomb, where we took refuge, an undead horde accosted us. Asauin became sick from their touch, we are now miserably weak and unfit to continue. After destroying the creatures, we found a pittance of coins.

Yet we press on, to Orenstar. Immediately, the weight of the place caused Asauin to visibly shake and mutter about how we've done ourselves in. She began to despair greatly.

A shrouded figure assailed us! A poltergeist with a gaping maw and thrashing wispy tendrils! Cunningly, we used some of our resources (tokens + Cunning II) to stave off the worst it could do, but we found ourselves feeling as though our luck had gotten even worse (Disadvantage).

Orenstar will be our death. What happens when exhaustion takes over and you wander into a hallway full of magical symbols?
Poisonous afflictions and Aremtat being rendered unconcious.
Though, all was not lost, we were able to gain some insight from the inscriptions (lore token).
How could it get worse?

We left the main structure, in an attempt to find shelter, but found ourselves lost (Lost Peril: reset all wayponts) on a wayward path, fatigued. Even if we find a place to rest, I fear it will not be sufficient. We found ourselves back where we started, searching Orenstar.

We came across the most dreadful stairway - we were unable to navigate the obstacle, which furthere stymied our progress (adding another Lost Peril, which turns into Doom) - of which, there has been precious little.

All is lost.

A great unmoving door stands in our path. There is no way forward, our skills have been taxed and doom is mounting. We decided to devour our provisions right in the shadow of the door to rest as best we could (Doom Rest: perform a rest action, but gain Doom - the party now has 2 Doom).

While it has done some good, our rest was fitful, Asauin barely recovered. While the plague that the undead festered upon Asauin has ebbed, she is still in a miserable state. But, we had to make haste as there must be rains outside, the chamber we made as camp has begun to flood!

We lost some of our gear in our mad scramble to escape! The chamber was well into flooding by the time we realized which way to go (extra difficulty for Delay peril - but now we can remove that peril)
Our loss was not terrible though, just some strange trophy we could use to purchase gear - I don't think we'll be going on another expedition though.

Our unplanned escape brought us into something terrifying. An ancient trap meant to steal away the spirit of those unfortunate enough to come across it. However, there is also silence here - perhaps Asauin may gather her strength, and indeed her spirit has recovered, miraculously in this place.

As we left a main structure, we came upon a wailing monolith that struck both Cosa and Aremtat. Asauin, having regained her spirit, was able to avoid the damage that would have slain her (Siren Monolith, she has 1 body and it was injured, this would have killed her).
While Cosa and Aremtat were left reeling, the outcome could have been worse.

We leave Orenstar behind us, through trees that seem to speak - their message of doom and despair will not avail! We were also fortuitous to find provisions amongst the trees.
