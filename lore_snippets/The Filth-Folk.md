The Filth-Folk

The Filth-Folk are a peculiar race of amphibious beings characterized by their aberrant, frog-like physiology and lamentable disposition. Their sentience is undeniable, yet they exhibit a shocking disregard for hygiene and the welfare of their surroundings.

A community of Filth-Folk has recently settled in close proximity to Bol Herata, and their presence has brought with it a grievous crisis. Their unbridled waste and pollution have contaminated a vital river used for nourishing cattle and irrigating the fields, resulting in the devastating demise of crops and widespread sickness among the local populace.

Despite numerous diplomatic overtures and peace-seeking initiatives, all such endeavors have met with resounding failure. The most recent envoys dispatched to engage in peaceful negotiations met a gruesome fate, their lifeless forms discovered adrift on the poisoned river, grotesquely impaled on wooden rafts.

In light of these dire circumstances, the moment has arrived when forceful action becomes the only viable recourse to resolve the issue at hand.
