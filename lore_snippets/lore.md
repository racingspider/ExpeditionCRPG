*Irrik Ek* (Mentetupeh and Harcaleptu, Rozigash - who was slain)
The Ruinous years mark a dark and grievous chapter in humanity's history, leaving behind a festering wound of unspeakable atrocities committed by both humans and malevolent intruders.

In a distant, forgotten era, a sinister temple was erected to pay homage to these horrors. Its malevolence lingers to this day, haunting those who cast their gaze upon it. This accursed place was named "Irrik Ek," translating to the "Temple of the Wicked," and its very foundations were tainted with the foul essence of their depravity.

In a valiant effort to combat the great and monstrous abominations that terrorized the lands, Jonas led his accursed regiment to this unholy ground. Alongside him were the Siblings, cursed by an unearthed relic, and together, they stood as a formidable barrier, slowing the advance of the Wicked just long enough for Devon to construct his magnificent wards of eternal light. These wards served as a shield, safeguarding the people of Esa Avte who resided behind the formidable walls of Bol Herata.

Legends tell of Azukenasi, the Plagueblade, which was said to have been forcibly wrenched from the mangled grasp of Rozigash, the malevolent being vanquished by Hektir, the apprentice wizard. Hektir fled the tainted temple while Mentetupeh, a force of chaos, wrought destruction across the countryside. Hektir's triumphant acquisition of this macabre trophy earned him full membership as a wizard and marked him with the prestigious wizard's emblem. Since that fateful event, no living soul has set eyes upon the Plagueblade, leaving open the possibility that other relics may lie concealed within Irrik Ek's shadowy depths.

Whispers persist that Harcaleptu, the Hand of Mentetupeh, once dwelled within the sinister confines of Irrik Ek. An ancient expedition, long past, recounted a dreadful encounter with Harcaleptu. "Its fathomless eyes," they described, "were the truest horror of the thing, not mere lifeless black orbs, but hollow pits of swirling vortices of dim green stars."

The key to reclaiming a world ravaged by darkness may lie concealed within the enigmatic temple located far to the east. It has only been glimpsed from the ominous Wasted Forest, and no soul has ventured there and returned to share their experience. A lingering terror pervades that place, and its very heartbeat resonates through the blackened earth, serving as a grim reminder of the malevolence that festers within.
