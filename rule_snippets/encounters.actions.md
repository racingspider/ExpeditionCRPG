# ACTIONS
Encounters display multiple actions that can be performed. A Character can only take one of the listed actions.

## APPLIES TO
Encounters, Settings

## RULE
* Play X
* Discard Peril
* Rest
* Gain Token
* Sort Treasure


### Play X
This action allows a character to play up to X Play Cards (aspects, tokens, items, archetype) to defeat the encounter's threats. The infinity symbol indicates that any number of cards may be played. 


### Discard Peril
This action allows a character to remove a peril that also bears the "Discard Peril" icon. No other action can be taken.


### Rest (1) _or Recover when it is on an Encounter_
A rest action allows a character to refresh Play Cards, remove Weary, Despair, Injury and Shock. When a rest action appears on an Encounter, it applies only to the character that took that action. Play Cards that can be paid for are refreshed, with Weary Peril being discarded in it's place. 
1. Refresh Play Cards and if your character has Weary:
	- Discard a Weary for each Play Card that could be refreshed, and leave that Play Card exhausted.
2. Convert one each of Despair, Injury, Shock back to attribute (flip it back over), for each recovered, gain a weary.


_Rest Example_



### Gain Token
The character that takes this action gains a token with a matching Glyph. The character must legally be able to hold this token.


### Gain Treasure _Marker_(?) Maybe just call it Loot?
The treasure chest icon indicates that something of value has been found. Add a single Treasure _Marker (or Loot?)_ to the team's cache. These _Markers_ can be sorted through later to determine what was found. Additionally, other actions may consume them, or cause them to become lost, or serve another purpose on the adventure.


### Sort Treasure _This action appears less frequently on Encounters_
Sorting treasure allows the team to spend treasure _Markers_ for drawing cards from the Treasure Deck. Once _Markers_ are spent, they cannot be converted back into _Markers_. The Setting card normally shows the exchange rate for converting _Markers_ into treasure draws.
