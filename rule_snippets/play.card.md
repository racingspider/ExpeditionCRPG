# The Play Card
Play Cards represent the way in which the characters interact with the environment and how they deal with their current situation/scenario.

## Play Card Types
* Aspect - represented by a "sun" icon in the lower right
* Token - represented by a "coin" icon in the lower right
* Item - represented by a "mallet" icon in the lower right
* Archetype - represented by a "ribbon" icon in the lower right

### Aspect Play Cards
Aspect cards represent the abilities, skills and characteristics of a character. Aspects are selected during character creation and character improvement.
Aspect Play Cards generally remain with the character. Aspect Play Cards are identified by a sun icon in the lower right.

### Tokens
These are temporary, situational or consumable resources. Tokens can be gained by playing some cards, as rewards for encounters and at the start of an adventure. 
Examples include:
* Tonics
* High Morale
* Situational Advantage


_Combining Tokens_
If an ability allows "combining tokens", this means that two of the same Glyph token can be converted into one with two Glyphs of that type.

_Assignment_
Tokens are assigned to a specific character unless otherwise noted. A token is a Play Card and will trigger special abilities in the same way as an Aspect Play Card.

### Items
These represent exceptional items that are magic, reknown or otherwise out of the ordinary. They have a wealth value which can be used outside the adventure (such as in the Home Turn).
Examples include:
* Fading Magic Sword
* Wizard Armor
* Flaming Sword: In Hand - When this character plays a card with Fight, add another Fight Glyph.
				 When Played - Two Fight, Two Magic Glyph

### Archetypes
These cards further define a character and have multiple Glyphs. A character may only have one Archetype, which does not count towards the character's hand size upon creation.
The Archetype card can be played as a normal Play Card, however it refreshes automatically after completing the current Setting.


## Play Card State

_In Hand_
This card is ready and available to be played. Abilities that shows the 'in-hand' icon are also available to be invoked.

_Exhausted_
This card is not able to be played, but is available to be refreshed.

_Played_
When a card is activated, it is considered to be Played. Once its abilities and Glyphs have been applied, it becomes exhausted.

*Note*
There is a different between "Playing" a card and exhausting a card. If a rule specifies exhausting a card, it does not apply Glyphs or invoke "when played" effects.

*Note*
Some abilities or effects mention "Return to Hand". In this case, an exhausted Play Card is returned to In Hand status, but does not invoke any abilities on any cards.

## Refresh Cost
The lower left of the Play Card shows the refresh cost. These are the attributes that must be available to move the card from exhausted to in hand. The total number of cards and their cost must not exceed the character's available attribute points. For instance, _Arcanist_ requires 1 spirit, and _Cunning II_ requires 1 spirit. This means, that to refresh both, a character must have 2 spirit. 


### Refreshing Exhausted Play Cards
When a character exhausts a Play Card, it becomes temporarily unavailable for future actions until refreshed. Refreshing a Play Card allows a character to regain its usefulness and access its abilities once again.

The number of Play Cards a character can refresh depends on the corresponding attribute values. Mind, Body, and Spirit attributes govern the refreshment allotment for Play Cards associated with the attributes.

A character can refresh Play Cards up to the value of their corresponding attribute. For example, a character with a Mind attribute of 3 can refresh Mind-associated Play Cards with a total refresh cost of 3 or less. Similarly, a character with a Body attribute of 2 can refresh up to two Body-associated Play Cards, and so on.

However, some Play Cards may have multiple attribute refresh costs. In such cases, the character must allocate their attribute values strategically to refresh the desired combination of Play Cards. For instance, if a Play Card has a refresh cost of "Mind 2, Spirit 1," the character must allocate at least 2 points from their Mind attribute and 1 point from their Spirit attribute to refresh that specific Play Card.

On the other hand, certain Play Cards may have no refresh cost. These Play Cards do not require attribute allocation for refreshment and can be refreshed freely without needing any attribute points.

Strategic planning and managing your attribute values effectively are crucial to ensure a steady supply of refreshed Play Cards throughout the game. Consider the attribute costs of each Play Card, allocate your attribute points wisely, and make the most out of your resources to overcome Threats.
