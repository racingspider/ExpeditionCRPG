# QUESTS AND SETTINGS

## STARTER SET (CORE SET)
Wild Lands need to be included.
Bol Herata and Esa Avte start locations.
The Red Tower
Yagishamot


Quests are used to build up characters and gain access to higher level equipment.
Quest cards are Square, like Settings and Start Locations.
Quests have a distance from starting areas - some starting areas are closer and thus, have less Settings in between.

## SETTINGS
Settings come in two varieties, Settings and Destinations. Destinations are the "end point" for a quest. The quest will determine which Destination to use. Destinations that are NOT part of a quest are set aside (but their corresponding Settings are included, representing passing by that area).

_Wild Lands_
Windswept Plataeu



_Yicht_

-- Where is Yicht?
Settings
	* That place where they eat curious berries
	* Plains of the hoogie boogie beasts: evil, man - every encounter adds a CUNNING glyph
	* Tasakta Band (an ancient city that had walls, but it fell)
	* Saltmarsh: action - spend LORE to gain POTION TOKEN (tonic or unguents and salves)
	* The Long Dark




Yicht is one of Ursamao's five wanderers.
Yicht exists in a state of perpetual disfigurement, a grotesque fusion of sinew, flesh, and bone that defies human proportions. Its very existence is a blasphemous aberration against the natural order, a jarring amalgamation of disparate anatomical fragments fused together. The creature's shape is in a constant flux, as its bones break and reform in a grotesque symphony of agony, allowing it to move in unsettling, unnatural ways.

Its skeletal structure is a macabre spectacle, as its jagged bones pierce through its skin in a perverse parody of anatomy. With each bone fracture, Yicht emits a cacophony of sickening cracks, echoing through the desolate tombways. But what is most revolting is the way its shattered bones regrow and interlock, defying the boundaries of mortality, knitting together with a disturbing sentience that mocks the coherence of mortal understanding.

Its visage is a maddening paradox, simultaneously repulsive and captivating. The sight of its broken, reassembling form is an affront to the very concept of life, a grim reminder that Ursamao is a malevolent entity that delights in perverting the laws of existence.



Defeating Yicht:
Defeating Yicht, the abomination of bones and eldritch deformity, is a perilous endeavor that defies conventional means. Its very existence challenges the limits of mortal comprehension, rendering traditional strategies impotent in the face of its monstrous form. However, there are whispers of obscure methods that may grant a glimmer of hope in vanquishing this otherworldly horror.

Relics of Power: Legends speak of relics imbued with ancient, forgotten forces that can disrupt Yicht's unnatural regeneration. Seek out relics of primordial power, artifacts forged in realms beyond mortal reach, that possess the ability to disrupt the interlocking of its shattered bones and hinder its maddening movements.

Esoteric Lore: Delving into ancient tomes and forbidden texts of arcane knowledge might reveal hidden secrets about Yicht's origins, vulnerabilities, or weaknesses. Unearthly incantations and occult rituals, passed down through generations of arcane scholars, may hold the key to unraveling the creature's enigmatic nature.


# The Red Tower
_The Red Tower_ was a Wizard's tower, beyond Fort Brin along the river Esa Qois. Overwhelmed in 16,504 _The Red Tower_ was one of the last bastions outside Esa Avte. It remains one of the most known possible destinations for an expedition crew, as a recent scouting party discovered its location.

# THE HORRORS
5 different "base" monsters, then pick up to 4 Traits (based on the base):
For instance:

YUG YUG
-------
Pick two {moon symbol} Threats => Poisonous (causes affliction), Violent (double injury)
Pick one {shield symbol} Traits => Sprawling (Navigation is taboo)
	{ shield symbol } has abilities and taboo glyphs that do not interfere with the base creature's opposing glyphs (to counter threats), so there should be enough different symbols for that.
This can be used to build many horrors to face

Other traits could be deadly breath:
Any character without magic in hand takes INJURY
