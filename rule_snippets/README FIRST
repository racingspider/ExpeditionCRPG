README FIRST

+--------------------+
---General Overview---
+--------------------+
The JadeRules document goes into details about the different cards and is a work in progress.

For testing out the rules in their current status, use this starting guide alongside the rules.
Not all of the rules are created yet, but a general sense of the game can be gained by playing the "core" game loop.


+--------------------+
----Current Status----
+--------------------+
There are missing decks (such as the Treasure Deck) as well as not nearly enough Settings. When you gain a treasure, simply add a yellow cube as the loot cube. Right now, there are not actions available on the settings to turn them into treasure deck draws. That'll come "soon".


+--------------------+
----Core Game Loop----
+--------------------+
In a "full career", a player will control multiple characters in different phases:
1. Home Turn - in this turn players create new characters and upgrade existing characters, trade items for wealth, etc.
2. Expedition - 
	a. Select a Quest (not ready yet) 
	b. Select a viable Starting Location (not ready yet, but they will be City, Village, Outpost), the starting location notes what Tokens can be taken and other rules 
	c. Draw two Setting cards and select one to be the Setting the crew makes encounters against first.
	d. Draw an encounter from the top waypoint (or rest if it is a rest)
	e. After completing the encounter, draw another encounter (the next one down the list), until all encounters have been drawn.
	f. Draw two more Settings and pick one to travel to, discarding the one not selected.

-- For this Tutorial--
+--------------------+
The playtest may be a bit "wandery" feeling, but we're trying to dial in some of the core concepts and game play. Rest assured that Quests are coming and so are bosses and elite encounters.

Create 3 Level 1 characters. Characters can have ONE Archetype card which does not count towards the Hand Size of that character. Additionally, to defeat The Living Ward, you must play specific Tokens (2x Lore, 2x Magic), ensure that the characters you bring can hold these Tokens.

Pick 2 Tokens per character to take with, keeping in mind that each character has some limitations on what Tokens they can hold. Additionally, make sure at least a couple are bringing provisions (most common way to rest).

THE QUEST
Track down The Living Ward and destroy it.
Travel 12 Distance
Acquire 2 sign, 1 moon, 2 mask, 3 ruin (from choosing setting cards).

When you select a setting to travel through, you gain the quest resources shown on the card after completing each encounter.

Once you've acquired the resources, shuffle Living Ward's attack deck and overcome its encounters until the completion conditions are met, or the team is slain.
