# TREASURES

*Playable*
This means the treasure can be activated with a Play Card action.

*Communal*
This means that any character can activate the treasure to gain its benefits.

*Home Turn*
In preparation for an adventure, the player can perform actions in the home turn. If a treasure is exhausted in the home turn, it cannot be taken with on an adventure.

## Artifacts
These form the base of reusable wealth and powerful items for adventurers.
