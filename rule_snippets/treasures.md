# TREASURES

*Coin Sack*

*Lore Tablet*

*Jewelry*

*Artifact*
This allows you to make a draw from the Artifacts deck. You can do this at any time during the adventure or when you return home. An artifact treasure can be sold without revealing the item in town.




## Artifacts
These form the base of reusable wealth and powerful items for adventurers.

## Trinket Treasures
Trinkets occupy a Token Slot and are playable. When played, they become exhausted like play cards. However, when a trinket is exhausted, it no longer takes a Token Slot.

## Terminology
*Playable*
This means the treasure can be activated with the Play Card action.

*Communal*
This means that any character can activate the treasure to gain its benefits and it does not require a Token slot to hold in the team's inventory.
