# TABOO
These glyphs are penalized when played during an encounter.

## APPLIES TO
Encounters

## RULE
A Play Card that bears a Glyph that is displayed in the _taboo_ section of the Encounter is considered to have _no_ Glyphs. _When Played_ effects are still activated.

## EXAMPLE
The Encounter _Are They Silent_ has the Fight glyph displayed in the taboo section. A character may play _Strategist_ (glyphs: Fight, Cunning) to activate the _when played_ effect 'Gain _Weary_ to gain and play Action and Navigate Tokens if possible.'
The glyphs Fight and Cunning will be ignored, but the character will get the tokens (if he has room) and play them immediately.
