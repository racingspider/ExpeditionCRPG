JADE - CRPG
The core rules encompass creating characters as well as playing cards and refreshing exhausted cards. Adventure rules can vary in execution, but rely on the system laid out here as the core.

CONCEPTS
- Play Cards:
	These determine a character's abilities and capabilities. Play Cards also represent superior equipment, negative conditions (perils), and temporary and situational boons.
	- Aspects, tokens, archetypes, cohorts items

- Character Cards:
	Represents one of the heroes of the adventure. The character card has the character's attributes, max hand size, tier and any special rules for that character.

- Attributes:
	Body: Measures the amount of physical harm this character can withstand. Body also determines how many exhausted play cards beraring the body icon this character can refresh. "Injury" is damage to the body or extreme fatigue and reduces the effect level of this attribute.
	Mind: epresents willpower, knowledge and determines the maount of mental anguish the character can tolerate. The mind attribute is used to refresh play cards with the mind icon. "Shock" is damage to the mind or extreme fatigue.
	Spirit: The character's spiritual force and emotional robustness is determined by spirit. Spirit is required to refresh play cards with the spirit icon. Damage to spirit is measure by "Despair".

- Hand Size:
	Represents the number of Aspect Play Cards to select when making this character. Hand size is only applicable when creating a character.

- Tier:
	Character tier is used to determine the general experience and power of a character. A higher tier character will have stronger attributes, hand size or abilities. Some adventures restrict or suggest certain tier characters.

- Special Rules:
	Some rules allow discounted refresh costs or other situational bonuses. Consulte the character card for detail.


1 PLAY CARDS
Play Card represent the way in which characters interact with the environment and how they deal with their current situation, encounter or scenario.

- ASPECTS
 Aspect cards represent the abilities, skills and characteristics of a character. Aspects are selected during character creation and level advancement. Aspect Play Cards generally remain with the character and define them.

- TOKENS
 These are temporary, situational or consumable resources. Tokens can be gained by playing some cards, as rewards for encounters and at the start of an adventure. Some examples are:
 	* tonics
 	* high morale
 	* situation advantage
 	* limited but useful knowledge
 Tokens are assigned to a specific character unless otherwise noted. Generally tokens have only a single glyph.

- ITEMS
 These represent exceptional items that are magic, reknown or otherwise out of the ordinary. They have a wealth level which can be used outside of adventures. And item can be:
 	* Fading Magic Sword
 	* Wizard's Armor

- COHORTS
 A small groupd of people, usually with 2 or 3 glyphs. Generally only able to be refreshed during extended rest/sanctuary. Cohorts do not "belong" to any specific character. A cohort cannot be played independeantly, another character must also make a play.
 Cohorts are destroyed:
 	* If they take 2 weary
 	* take shock, injury or despair peril

- ARCHETYPES
 These cards further define a character and have multiple glyphs. A character may only have one archetype. The archetype Play Card does not count towards the character's hand size.

- PLAY CARD STATE
 * In Hand - this card is ready and available to be played.
 * Exhausted - this card is not able to be played, but is available to be refreshed.
 * Played - When a card is activated, it is considered to be played. Once its abiltities and glyphs have been applied, it becomes exhausted.

 - Playing vs Exhausting
  Thesre is a difference between playing a card and exhausting a card. If a rule specificies exhausting a card, it does not apply glyphes or invoke "when played" effects.

2 CHARACTER CREATION
Select a character card to represent the character. Any tier character can be used, but some adventure require specific tiers. Higher tier characters have strong attributes, bigger hand size or other bonuses.

Once the character has been selected, you can pick as many Aspect Play Cards as the character's hand size (as indicated by a stack of cards with a number). Aspects have varying refresh costs which should be considered when making a character.

If a character has many aspects that require SPIRIT and she has a low SPIRIT attribute, it may be difficult to refresh exhausted cards.

Aspects with '+' (when gained) abilities grant those during character creation. For example an Aspect may have '+ add 1 to spirit'. When this card is gained, the character's SPIRIT attribute is increased by 1.

RARITY (Play Cards)
Rarity rules put limits on some cards and how many each character can have, as well as how many of that Aspect can be included in the crew as a whole. For instance, a "unique" card can only be included in one character in the crew.

* COMMON: Any number of characters can have any number of this named card.
* UNCOMMON: Any number of characters can have ONE of this named card.
* RARE: Only one character in the crew may have this named card. Additionally, a character may only have as many rare cards as his tier.
* UNIQUE: A character may have only one unique Aspect and are generally available only as rewards.

CHARACTER CREATION EXAMPLE
1. Pick a character card.
	For this example, I'll pick Conscript. This low-level characcer can refresh tier 1 Play Cards that have the FIGHT glyph for no cost. While he has low attributes, he'll be fine for the tutorial mission.
2. Select Aspect Play Cards
	For the Conscript's Rare card, I'll pick "Martial". While this tier 2 card can't be refreshed for free (only tier 1 cards can according to the Conscript's ability), it has a powerful 'In-hand' ability.
	* Martial
	* Navigate
	* Veteran
	* Seasoned
	* Battle studies
	* Arcanology
	* Stealth
	* Superstition
This completes the example character.
